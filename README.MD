Ezover is an easy to use internal overlay. However, it uses an external overlay window rather than hooking graphics APIs to make it more universal.. Uses DX9 and Imgui. 

In addition to exposing DX9 and ImGui, Ezover provides simple APIs for creating 3D overlays/ESPs. Just tell it where your camera transform and game objects are, and it will take care of the rest.
